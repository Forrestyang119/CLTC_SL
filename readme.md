# A Robust Self-Learning Framework for Cross-Lingual Text Classification

This is Pytorch implemenation of our paper: A Robust Self-Learning Framework for Cross-Lingual Text Classification, introduced by Xin Dong, Gerard de Melo.

## Requirements

```
python 3.7
pytorch 1.0
```

### Datasets

This sample code uses MLDoc dataset which is not public because of the privacy. 
You can request it on your own. Besides, you can create new data_processor for you own dataset in run_ld.py. 


### Training

Please run 

```
./run_ld.sh
```
